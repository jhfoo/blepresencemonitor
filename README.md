# Installation
- Ensure bluetooth binaries are loaded: instructions [here](https://github.com/noble/noble)

# Notes
- Last known version of Node on Raspbian to successfully install Noble is 8.11.4. Newer Node versions fail to compile/ install [bluetooth-hci-socket](https://github.com/noble/node-bluetooth-hci-socket). Tested using the awesome [n](https://github.com/tj/n) tool.
